[h1]Mario & Luigi: Crossover[/h1]
[h3]Explore Terraria worlds as your favorite Goomba-stomping plumber duo[/h3]


[h1]Prelude[/h1]
This mod is in its very early stages. Treat this version as a sort-of "development alpha build". Not all content and mechanics have been added, and existing ones have not been heavily balanced or brute-tested. It is recommended that you create a new world with this mod on, and not play with other major content mods or with other people. This mod has little to none multiplayer / mod compatability.

Rest assured that everything is being worked on including the aforementioned shortcomings.

[h1]Credits[/h1]
Raythemaymay - Transformation sheet sprites and some miscellanious sprites
Momlob - The bulk of content and UI sprites
Exslueterra - A handful of sprites and sprite tweaks
Lolxd87 - Anything graphics-related, as well as just being incredibly supportful
Lugnut - Voice acting
Hencko - The owner of this mod's 1.3 version

[h1]Future plans[/h1]
This build mainly serves to establish important systems, such as the loadout, powerups, and transformations. In the future, expect lots of Mario representation, including enemies, Powerups, items, and even entire subworlds to explore!
